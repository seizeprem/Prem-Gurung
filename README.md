# 👤Prem-Gurung
I'm a passionate and determined cybersecurity professional with a unique background that bridges the hospitality industry and information technology. I began my career with a bachelor’s degree in Hotel Management, working across major hotel chains, where I developed a deep understanding of customer experience, operational discipline, and service excellence — all of which now contribute to my people-focused and detail-oriented approach in IT.

Driven by a growing interest in digital security and the evolving tech landscape, I made a bold career shift and completed a master’s degree in Cybersecurity. This transition wasn’t just academic — it was a personal mission. I immersed myself in self-study, industry certifications, and capstone projects outside of formal coursework to build the real-world skills necessary for today’s fast-paced IT environments.

I’m currently engaged in research with a focus on cybersecurity, particularly in areas like secure systems design, digital forensics, and threat mitigation. My enthusiasm for IT extends beyond just career growth — I’m passionate about contributing to the global tech community, sharing knowledge, and collaborating on meaningful projects.

Though I’m early in my industrial career, my vision is long-term: to build a tech company that not only innovates but also serves society, helping secure digital spaces and positively impacting the world. I’m deeply inspired by the idea of using technology as a force for good — to transform lives, enhance security, and shape a better future.
